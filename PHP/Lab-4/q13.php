if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $number = $_POST["number"];

    if ($number % 2 == 0 && $number % 3 == 0) {
        echo "The number $number is divisible by both 2 and 3.";
    } elseif ($number % 2 == 0) {
        echo "The number $number is divisible by 2.";
    } elseif ($number % 3 == 0) {
        echo "The number $number is divisible by 3.";
