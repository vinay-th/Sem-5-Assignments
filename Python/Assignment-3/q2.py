# 2. Write a Python program that creates a package called “SEM6” which consists of core.py, ae.py
# and elective.py, core.py contains 4 function called python(), infosec(), se(), ai(). ae.py contains
# 2 function called dt() and drupal(). Also elective.py contains 1 function called ML(). Create one
# main file outside the SEM6 package and import SEM6 to access core.py, elective.py and ae.py
# file using init .py file. Call all the functions in main file using the concept of Package.
